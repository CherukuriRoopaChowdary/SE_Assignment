# Research Code Repository

This repository contains code and datasets for two research questions:

## Research Question 1 - RC23M

**Objective:** Identify common quality issues in the code generated by ChatGPT, focusing on issues identified by linters.

- **Code File:** `Assignment_SE.ipynb`
- **Dataset:** `20231012_235320_discussion_sharings.json`

### Dataset Information

The analysis utilizes the `20231012_235320_discussion_sharings.json` dataset, which contains conversation data between developers and ChatGPT.

### Code Overview

1. **Define Quality Metrics:** This step includes establishing rules for indentation, variable naming conventions, syntax rules, and other relevant metrics.
2. **Selection of Linter:** A linter is chosen to identify issues, enforce coding standards, and enhance code consistency.
3. **Automated Analysis:** The selected linter is systematically applied to each code file in the dataset using a script or program. This automated process efficiently identifies issues and deviations from the defined quality metrics, enabling a thorough examination of the code generated by ChatGPT for common quality issues.

## Research Question 2 - KB23U

**Objective:** Investigate the possibility of forecasting whether a developer will incorporate ChatGPT-generated code into a production environment based on their interactions with ChatGPT during a conversation.

- **Code File:** `RESEARCH_QUE-2_KB23U.ipynb`
- **Dataset:** `discussion_sharings.json`

### Execution

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Run the cells and execute the code.

### Dataset Information

The analysis utilizes the `discussion_sharings.json` dataset, containing conversation data between developers and ChatGPT.

### Code Overview

- **Data Processing:** Extracts prompts and answers from the JSON dataset, writing them to a CSV file (`prompts_answers.csv`).
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes the NLTK Sentiment Intensity Analyzer to assign sentiment scores to answers.
- **Feature Extraction:** Applies TF-IDF vectorization to prompts and answers, computing additional features such as sentiment, conversation length, and user experience.
- **Model Training:** Trains a Dummy Classifier on sentiment features to explore the baseline performance of sentiment prediction.
